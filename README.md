This is my final project for EECS 1021 - Object Oriented Programming with Sensors and Actuators.
I integrated hardware and software in one of my favorite programming languages to create a practical solution.
I used the JFreeChart library along with the Firmata4j library to connect to my arduino setup.
free free to use! :)
